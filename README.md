# IRB

## Introduction

* IRB stands for "interactive ruby"
* IRB allows you to execute ruby in the terminal
* To access irb, just type irb in the terminal
* IRB allows you to do anything you can do in a Ruby file. For instance, you can do math, get the time by typing `Time.now`, or print text to the screen.

## Instructions

* Open up your terminal (press `command` and `space bar` to search on a Mac, then type terminal, then hit `return`).
* Type `irb` and hit `return`
* Now that you've started IRB, type the commands below to see how it works!
  * Time.now
  * 255 / 5
